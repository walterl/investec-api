# Introduction

This library is a Clojure wrapper for [Investec's Programmable Banking API](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/).

Use `investec-api.auth/access-token` to obtain an API token, and pass it to
functions in `investec-api.accounts` to interact with the API.

See the project [README](https://github.com/walterl/investec-api) for more details.
